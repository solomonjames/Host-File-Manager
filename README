### Setup
#####################

1. Copy the code in "bash_hfm" into your ".profile", ".bash_profile", 
   etc file in your home directory.

   Mac:
       $ cat bash_hfm >> ~/.profile

   Linux
       $ cat bash_hfm >> ~/.bash_profile

2. Reload your terminal window, either by running "source .profile" or just
   closing and opening it up again

3. Run the following command to create the needed directories and do all the setup

   $ mkdir ~/.hfm && cd ~/.hfm && mkdir files && touch main && cat /etc/hosts > ~/.hfm/main && sudo rm /etc/hosts && sudo ln -s ~/.hfm/hostsfile /etc/hosts && h default

   -- This will make the hfm directory that will store the file, 
      "hostsfile", which will then be symlinked to from /etc/hosts.

4. You are now all setup

#####################
### Explanation
#####################

~/.hfm/main : This file is used to be here as a static file that can hold 
              host file entries you would wish to always be present, 
              i.e. 127.0.0.1 localhost

~/.hfm/files : This is where all your different host files will be held

~/.hfm/hostsfile : This is the current host file your system is linking to

#####################
### Usage
#####################

Add a new host file:
    $ cd ~/.hfm/files
    $ vim google
        -- Add your entries
    Done!

Load a host file:
    $ h google

Load X number of host files:
    $ h google test yahoo local
    -- All of these files must exist, and each will just be
       appended to the end of the other

List your host files:
    $ hl

Reset to default:
    $ h default
    -- This actually just loads whatever is in the "main" file, and thats it
